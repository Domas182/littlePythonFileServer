## Little Python File Server
This repository contains a simple yet robust file server built with Python's Flask framework. It provides a web interface for uploading and downloading files, including a progress bar for large uploads.
The application is served using Waitress, but you can also use flask's built-in development server.

### Dependencies
- Flask
- Waitress
- Python3

### Configuration
Before running the server, you may need to modify the UPLOAD_FOLDER variable in the app.py file to point to your desired file storage location.
